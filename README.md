# webextension-notuni-hacks
a web extension for a web browser (wow) that will hopefully be submitted to notuniversity hacks
to install, just go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox (yes you do need to be on firefox for this) after downloading this repo. Then when a menu pops up just click any of the files in the extension and it should work!
